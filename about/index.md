Why hello there,

I am 17 years old, a hobbyist programmer based in [Paramaribo, Suriname](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Paramaribo/@5.8483205,-55.2478873,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8d083520e203f743:0x97cf2079da3f4063!8m2!3d5.8520355!4d-55.2038278) and am really passionate about programming.

I have a moderate amount of experience with [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and [C/C++](https://cs-fundamentals.com/tech-interview/c/difference-between-c-and-cpp.php) programming.

> Some added extras are that I am experienced with web development ([Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/), [React.js](https://reactjs.org), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), etc) and some [Linux Kernel Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loadable_kernel_module) development.

Some of the things I've written were distributed web crawlers (for price extraction from online stores & the entire internet? lol) and a small UPnP client library for Python.

From time to time, usually when I'm bored, I do some random penetration testing on websites / software with the hopes of finding something interesting :)
